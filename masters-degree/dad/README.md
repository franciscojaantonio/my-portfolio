### DADTKV 
A distributed transactional key-value store to manage data objects (each data object being a <key, value> pair) that reside in server memory and can be accessed concurrently by transactional programs that execute in different machines.

To better understand the project, please take a look at our [report](DADTKV_Report_G10.pdf).
